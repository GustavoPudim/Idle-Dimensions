# How to play
(All the following quantities presume you have no upgrades for changing them)

**Dimensions**

All dimensions produce a multiplier, which increases your total matter per second, *m/s = 1st Dim mult * 2nd Dim mult... * Last Dim mult*.

The higher the dimension tier, the slower it production becomes, *mult/s = 1/2^(T-1)*.

Each dimension you buy, makes it more expensive by 1.8x.

When you get to 100 of any dimension, you can't buy anymore of it without *Prestiging*. Prestiging gets you back to have none of the respective dimension (although actually the "lost" dimensions are still producing), but give you a 10x bonus por its production.

**Black Holes**

When you reach 1e50 matter, black holes are unlocked. You can reset all your previous progress for some amount of black holes, accordingly to how much matter you have, *1.2^(log(m) - 50)*.

With these black holes, you're able to buy black hole upgrades. They make your progress much faster and are not reset by compressing.
